## Built With

https://regex101.com/

I used regex101 instead of the provided link because this one has a better UI

## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.


I did not use anyones code but I did use this regex learning website to study up: https://regexone.com/
